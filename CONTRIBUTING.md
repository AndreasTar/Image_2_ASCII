# How to contribute to this project

**Follow the [style guide](#style) and try to stick to a similar coding style as the project has**.

**Prefer to stick to current issues, the road map and todo list**. 
[Here](#where-is-the-todo-list-and-roadmap) you can find out how to find them.

Each pull request should **stick to a single problem or feature to add**, do not mix them into the same.
**Bug fixes may contain multiple** bug fixes in the same pull request as it is considered similar. 

On **bug fixes** create a **patch note in the pull request message** so we know which bugs has been patched.

> [!Note]
> Use type hints

> [!Important]
> If you are fulfilling an issue refer to that issue number in the commits or pull request message
